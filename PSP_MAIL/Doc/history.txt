Legend:

[!] - bug fixed
[+] - feature added
[-] - feature removed
[*] - miscellaneous/cosmetic change


Version 1.4.5.0065 - Release Version

[*] - cleaned up for release.
[*] - updated UTL_B64 to 1.2.0:
      - added automatic charset conversion in encode_mime_header
        on supported Oracle releases. This feature is optional
        and is controlled by new argument defaulted to false.
[*] - updated license enforcement package to 1.1.0010:
      - fixed a bug that could cause license keys to be decoded 
        incorrectly in rare cases.
      - increased licensee name length.
      - added verbal descriptions for all existing error codes in
        ErrorMessage().
      - the package no longer requires SELECT privilege on V$SESSION
        view.

Version 1.4.5.0064

[*] - instrumentation now preserved in release versions to simplify
      remote debugging/problem resolution.
[*] - re-included the FAQ.txt file that we forgot to ship in previous
      release.
[*] - updated UTL_BinFile to Version 1.0.7
[!] - sometimes space characters were incorrectly removed from headers


Version 1.4.5.0063

[*] - misc internal optimizations.


Version 1.4.4.0062 - Release Version

[*] - cleaned up for release.


Version 1.4.4.0061

[*] - header folding now does not take place within angle brackets,
      as this may confuse some MTAs and result in corrupt headers.
[*] - optimized reqcheck.sql script a bit.
[*] - updated UTL_BinFile to 1.0.6, with important 9i JDBC driver bug
      workaround.


Version 1.4.3.0060 - Release Version (unreleased)

[*] - cleaned up for release


Version 1.4.3.0059 - Release Candidate 1

[!] - fixed Date header generation on pre-9i databases when fractional
      GMT_DIFF is specified - now correct number of minutes is calculated
      for UTC offset.
[+] - PSP_Mail now uses the session time zone on Oracle9i and later
      for Date header generation. GMT_DIFF is now ignored on 9i+, but 
      is still used on 8i.


Version 1.4.3.0058

[!] - fixed MX lookup not resolving standalone hosts (that is, if recipient
      is specified as user@host.domain then MX lookup for "host.domain" domain
      is performed, but no A lookup to check if this is a standalone host is
      done if MX lookup fails - now additional A lookup is done in case MX
      lookup fails.)


Version 1.4.2.0057 - Release Version

[*] - cleaned up for release


Version 1.4.2.0056 - Release Candidate 1

[*] - SMTP Authentication now works automatically with all SendMailXXX versions
      (SendMail, SendMailEx and SendMailEx2.)


Version 1.4.2.0055

[+] - added support for SMTP Authentication extension (RFC-2554). Authentication 
      methods supported are LOGIN and CRAM-MD5. Added AUTH_USERNAME and
      AUTH_PASSWORD public variables to the PSP_Mail package - these are used
      for authentication if not NULL and SMTP server supports authentication.
      These variables are never reset internally, it is up to the developer to
      initialize and reset them properly. Both are NULL by default, which
      causes no authentication to take place.
[+] - added com.nnetworks.CryptoHash class to the psp_mail.jar - this class is
      needed for CRAM-MD5 authentication method support. The class implements MD5
      and SHA-1 secure hash algorithms and HMAC algorithm (RFC-2104).
[*] - changed versioning to major.minor.release.build style.


Version 1.41.0054 - Release Version.

[*] - cleaned up for release.


Version 1.41.0053 - Release Candidate 1

[*] - Better error reporting for multiple recipient transactions through the
      relay server: now rejected recipients are reported through new 511
      error.
[+] - While sending to multiple recipients, the package now checks for RCPT
      command reply code and detects when server's recipient buffer is full.
      When such reply code is received, the package commits the mail 
      transaction and starts new transaction for remaining recipients. This
      change is to comply with RFC-2821 minimum limit of 100 recipients per 
      transaction (RFC says that the server must accept at least 100 recipients
      per transaction, but not necessarily more than that, so we need to
      watch when the server's buffer is full and initiate new transaction. We
      do not want to break the list in chunks of predefined length though,
      because the server may accept more than 100 recipients at once and in 
      this case less transactions may be needed.)


Version 1.41.0052

[*] - CLOB_To_Strings now won't raise an exception if NULL CLOB is passed in,
      empty Strings array will be returned instead.
[*] - Improved the logic in SendMailEx2 with regard to To: header generation. 
      v_to is now not supposed to contain a valid email address list, it can be
      any string. Note that in this case at least one address should be 
      supplied in either v_cc or v_bcc, otherwise an error will be generated. 
      Also note that presence of single @ character in v_to indicates that this
      argument contains at least one email address and will cause address line 
      decoding to take place.
[!] - SendMailEx2 Bcc: recipients could appear in To: line of the message. This
      has been fixed.
[!] - exceptions were not sometimes handled properly and were propagated to
      the caller (in contrast with what the documentation says.) This has been
      fixed.


Version 1.41.0051

[+] - added automatic EHLO negotiation for 8-bit MIME transport if 
      Content-Transfer-Encoding is not explicitly specified in OTHER_HEADERS
      or specified as 8bit. If the remote server does not support EHLO or
      by occasion does not support 8BITMIME extension, the message will still
      be delivered with Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit and *may* be crippled
      by the server. For 100% guaranteed delivery you should still encode the
      message and/or headers with non-ASCII characters using Base64.
[*] - Updated UTL_BinFile to v1.04 - added ability to create and alter ZIP
      archives stored as internal BLOBs. You can manipulate external archives
      as well - simply load an archive into a BLOB with Load_BLOB_From_File,
      alter it as needed, and save it back with Save_BLOB_To_File.
[*] - Updated loadmail9i scripts to load correct UTL_BinFile Java classes file.


Version 1.40.0050 - Release Version

[*] - cleaned up for release
[*] - UTL_BinFile is no longer dropped in dropall.sql since it may be
      installed separately and still be in use.


Version 1.40.0049 - Release Candidate 2

[*] - improved internal MIME header extraction routine
[+] - updated UTL_BinFile package to 1.03.007 - added ability to delete and
      rename files and directories, create new directories, and compress/
      decompress BLOBs using 'deflate' and 'gzip' methods.
[*] - waived the requirement for 8.1.7.1 patchset/1512417 bug fix.


Version 1.40.0048 - Release Candidate 1

[*] - even more optimizations.
[!] - fixed prerequisites check script so that it no longer looks for some
      TCP-related Java classes on 9.2 (these classes are no longer necessary 
      as UTL_TCP was reimplemented in native C in this release.)
[+] - added installation scripts for Oracle9i (loadmail9i), backported them
      to 1.35 along with reqcheck.sql.

Version 1.40.0047

[*] - better internal exception handling.
[*] - more internal optimizations and redundant code elimination.
[*] - limited error report lines to 2000 characters. 
[+] - in ALWAYS_RELAY mode multiple recipient versions of SendMailEx and
      SendMailEx2 are now sending to all recipients in one mail transaction.
      Speed improvement and bandwidth savings are enormous, but nothing's
      free: the functions can't determine delivery status immediately in this
      mode (unless, of course, the relay server connection fails) and always
      report success for all targets - the relay server will then report actual
      status to the address specified as SENDER or in Return-Path header.
      This prevents from verifying addresses by return codes, which is possible
      in direct send mode.
      This feature is further controlled by the new RELAY_IN_SINGLETRANS
      package variable, which is TRUE by default. If you do not want the new
      behavior in ALWAYS_RELAY mode, set RELAY_IN_SINGLETRANS to FALSE
      before calling any SendMailEx[2] multi-recipient functions and the
      functions will generate and send a copy of the message for each recipient
      in separate transactions, as before.

Version 1.40.0046

[*] - internal optimizations to eliminate redundant code and improved
      message generation and internal caching.

Version 1.35.0045

[*] - repackaged JAR files without compression, as LOADJAVA in 8.1.6 does not
      accept compressed JARs.
[!] - fixed small bug in header parser, which could cause invalid trailing
      character to be appended to the extracted header value in some cases.

Version 1.35.0044

[!] - not all SendMailEx versions were parsing Return-Path header and assigning
      proper reverse path to the message. This has been fixed.

Version 1.34.0043


[*] - cleaned up for release.
[+] - added scanning for Return-Path: in OTHER_HEADERS. Address specified in
      this header is used with MAIL command if found, otherwise sender's
      email address is used. See FAQ Section 2.2.8 for details.

Version 1.34.0042

[!] - fixed bug where line breaks in message body were not always properly
      checked and fixed.
[!] - fixed bug introduced in v1.33 where some headers could be improperly
      placed into message body corrupting the message if certain values for
      OTHER_HEADERS were specified with SendMailEx call with attachment(s).
[*] - improved forced headers wrapping logic.
[*] - updated UTL_B64 to version 1.11.007.


Version 1.34.0041

[*] - updated UTL_B64 to version 1.11.006 - line length for encoded LOBs is
      increased to 76 characters. This should make generated messages a bit
      shorter. Also, LOB encoding speed improved significantly by LOB read 
      buffering.
[-] - removed Content-Length header generation for attachments as it is not
      necessary.
[*] - reqcheck.sql now verifies that running user is SYS.
[*] - increased sizes of some internal variables to allow accepting larger
      parameters in certain functions.
[*] - made the package resistant to DBMS_SESSION.RESET_PACKAGE effect of 
      resetting package variables to their defaults while NOT re-executing the
      package init block.
[+] - changed Version constant to function to avoid the above effect.


Version 1.33.0040 - Release Version

[+] - added updated UTL_BINFILE package, which now implements listing contents
      and reading files from server-side external (OS files) and internal (BLOB)
      ZIP or JAR archives. Documented new subprograms added to UTL_BINFILE in 
      PSP_Mail documentation.

Version 1.33.0039

[*] - internal loops over PL/SQL collections (arrays) are rewritten to be 
      resistant to holes in arrays (missing/unassigned elements.)
[!] - recipient names encoded to Base64 are now enclosed in double quotes,
      otherwise mail clients like Outlook/Outlook Express may misinterpret
      them and display them as separate recipient addresses.
[!] - internal long header wrapping routine now does not wrap Base64-encoded
      headers, as these should be already correctly broken into pieces. It is
      assumed that Base64-encoded headers are generated with 
      UTL_B64.ENCODE_MIME_HEADER function, which correctly wraps the resulting
      header.
[!] - fixed other_headers not getting into the main email headers section
      (they were only inserted into mail body section.) 
      Content-Transfer-Encoding header, if present, is stripped from main
      email headers and is only issued in body section to prevent mail client
      attempts to decode the whole message since it's not actually encoded.

Version 1.33.0038

[!] - internal long header wrapping routine now forcibly wraps headers at 80th
      character if no delimiter is located in current part.

Version 1.32.0037 - Release Version

[+] - exposed MXLookup function previously being internal to the package.
      Function allows to query DNS for MX for given host or domain. DNS
      query is always performed no matter ALWAYS_RELAY setting.
      Documented that getMXForEmail always returns relay server address if
      ALWAYS_RELAY is set to TRUE.
[*] - error reporting is now consistent throughout the package.
[+] - documented all error codes returned by package functions.

Version 1.32.0036

[*] - minor internal optimizations
[+] - all LOB arguments for SendMailXXX functions are no longer IN OUT, now
      they are IN.

Version 1.32.0035

[*] - package now uses UTL_SMTP.WRITE_RAW_DATA() to avoid automatic conversion
      of message content to US7ASCII and allow for 8-bit transfer encoding.
[!] - fixed minor bug in UTL_B64.decode(LOB) functions.
[*] - optimized UTL_B64 package LOB operations: added LOB write buffering
      and minimized LOB write calls, made all LOB arguments IN to enable
      using LOB-related functions in SQL. Package upgraded to v1.1.0005

Version 1.31.0034 - Release Version

[!] - fixed minor bug introduced in v1.30 where PSP_Mail would incorrectly
      convert address in form 'user@host.com' into canonic representation.

Version 1.30.0033 - Release Version

[*] - addresses in form 'Name user@host.com' (where email is not enclosed in
      angle brackets as per RFC-822) are now supported and parsed by 
      extractEmail and extractName correctly.
[+] - added CLOB_To_Strings function that converts input opened CLOB to
      Strings collection. May be used to pass CLOB as mail body.
[+] - installation script now prompts for package configuration parameters
      and puts provided values into package header before compiling it. To
      change config after installation you still need to change values in
      package header and recompile it.
[!] - potential problems with DBCS databases: DBMS_LOB treats amount for CLOB
      as number of characters requested while VARCHAR2 always treats size as
      bytes - this can lead to internal buffer overflows on DBCS systems as
      buffer should be twice as large as amount of data requested from CLOB.
      This fact is taken into account and all CLOB read operations are now 
      performed with amount being half of the buffer size. This may have 
      slight negative impact on performance when working with large CLOBs.
[*] - cleaned up for release.

Version 1.21.0032 (unreleased)

[*] - a few more internal optimizations.
[!] - renamed internal to_blob routine to avoid conflict with standard function
      introduced in 9i.
[!] - identified the source of ORA-1460 on emails with attachments in 8.1.7.0.0
      as side effect of Oracle bug #1512417 and updated system requirements
      in documentation to require 8.1.7.1 for Release 3 or one-off patch for 
      this bug installed on 8.1.6.

Version 1.20.0031

[*] - cleaned up for release.
[*] - few minor optimizations and tweaks.

Version 1.20.0030

[*] - further improved performance when mail is sent to multiple recipients.

Version 1.20.0029

[*] - optimized forced close of failed connections.

Version 1.20.0028

[*] - improved performance and reduced memory requirements of internal CLOB 
      to BLOB conversion
[*] - improved performance when mail is sent to multiple recipients.

Version 1.12.0027 - Release Version

[*] - cleaned up for release
[*] - updated License Management package to 1.1.0006
[*] - dropall.sql now drops public synonyms created for Java classes.
[+] - added List_Directory procedure to UTL_BINFILE, updated package to
      single instance (with AUTHID CURRENT_USER).
[+] - Attachments now have Content-Length specified to give a hint to mail
      reader clients about expected attachment size.
[*] - licensing module updated

Version 1.12.0026

[+] - added GMT_DIFF configuration parameter. Added automatic Date header 
      generation using GMT_DIFF offset from GMT.
[+] - added FileOperations Java class and UTL_BINFILE wrapper package to the 
      distribution. This Java class provides facility to load OS files into
      BLOBs and save BLOBs as OS files. It is intended to allow developers to
      attach OS files to email messages.
[+] - Documentation updated to document UTL_BINFILE package and provide 
      examples of use.

Version 1.11.0025 - Release Version

[*] - cleaned up for release

Version 1.11.0024 - Release Candidate 1

[!] - fixed bug that prevented correct To: header to be generated in some
      versions of SendMailEx.
[+] - PSP_Mail now correctly wraps long To: and Cc: headers so that they fit
      80 chars per header line restriction imposed by RFC-822.

Version 1.11.0023

[*] - fixed dropall.sql script to drop all public synonyms created with
      loadall.sql script to avoid synonym creation errors in loadall.sql
      when upgrading existing installation.
[+] - added prerequisite packages/Java classes check on installation. 
      Installation will now stop if either UTL_SMTP package or 
      oracle.plsql.net.TCPConnection class do not exist in the database.
[!] - fixed issue with different procedure parameters specification in package
      spec and body which prevented compilation on some versions of Oracle.

Version 1.11.0022

[*] - fixed a bug in MXLookup.class which caused java.lang.NullPointerException
      and a trace file to be generated when NULL was passed as domain to look
      up.

Version 1.11.0021

[+] - documented UTL_B64 package in main documentation
[+] - added encode_mime_header to the UTL_B64 package to encode headers
      in national character sets according to RFC-2047
[+] - added support for encoded strings in To:/From: headers 


Version 1.1.0020 - Release Version

[*] - added RelNotes.PDF document - Release Notes for Version 1.1
[*] - cleaned up for release version


Version 1.1.0019 - Release Candidate 3

[!] - fixed the way Cc: header was added, now it appears in correct place.
    

Version 1.1.0018 - Release Candidate 2

[*] - fixed installation script to create packages in correct order, and
      to create public synonym for Base64 Java class.
[!] - fixed headers generation in multipart messages.
[!] - fixed extra blank line in message if other_headers is terminated with
      CR/LF sequence.


Version 1.1.0017

[*] - changed the way Content-Transfer-Encoding is issued in multipart
      messages - now it is set to 8bit automatically if no transfer encoding
      is specified in other_headers.
[*] - upgraded UTL_B64 to v1.0.002 (added encodeva function to encode
      varchar2 arrays and vc_arr array type, compatible with PSP_Mail.Strings)
[*] - upgraded License Manager to Version 1.1
[!] - fixed bug with SendMailEx omitting From: header when only one
      attachment was passed.


Version 1.1.0016 - Release Candidate 1

[!] - fixed Cc: header line sometimes adding unnecessary extra CR/LF in 
      SendMailEx2.


Version 1.1.0015

[+] - Multiple recipients versions of SendMailEx now properly construct To:
      header to include addresses of all other recipients.
[!] - now all email addresses are converted to their canonic representation
      (["literal"] <address@host>) automatically to prevent '501 syntax error'
      from some strict hosts requiring that all addresses be in canonic form.


Version 1.1.0014

[!] fixed bug where Cc: header was always added even if v_cc was not specified
    in SendMailEx2.


Version 1.1.0012

[!] extra double quote character in charset default value for content_type 
    removed in several function definitions
[!] a bug in internal CLOB to BLOB conversion routine that generated exception
    when a closed CLOB was passed was fixed
[+] added SendMailEx2 and a set of procedures/functions for dealing with
    RFC-822 formatted addresses/address lists
[+] all occurences of CR and/or LF characters in message text are replaced with
    proper CR/LF sequences to avoid mail being rejected by qmail and other
    strict SMTP servers.
